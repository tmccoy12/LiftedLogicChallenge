<h3> Technologies Used </h3>
<ol>
<li>HTML5</li>
<li> CSS3</li>
<li> Slick Carousel </li>
</ol>

<br />
<h3> Task <h3>
<p> Build out Front-end Design using layout given. </p>
<br />
<h3> Challenges I Faced </h3>
<p> Trial and error when it came to matching the specs with only recieving minimum information. Responsive design is still something I struggle with here and there, but I am working on it.</p>

<h3>End Thought</h3>
<p>This was a good challenge for me, and I know I have a lot more to learn. I realize I need to learn more of the CSS options, and how to become faster at recognizing certain specs from layouts. I did enjoy working on this and Front-end is my passion. </p>
